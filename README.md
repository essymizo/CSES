Competitive Programming questions from CSES (https://cses.fi/problemset/). 

This competition requires code to run within time limit 1.0 s and no concession for Java code. 
Most of participants thus correctly chose other programming language and hardly Java. 
I took up the challenge of completing all questions in Java, but so far even an O(1) solution exceeds time limit. 
Most of code in this repo will be written in Java and when optimization fails, will shift to C++ or Python
